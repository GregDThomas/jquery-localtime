# jquery-localtime

This jQuery plug-in designed to display a time in the correct timezone for the viewer; ideal for international audiences of your web site.

For example, if you have an event happening at 10:00 PST (18:00 UTC), viewers in Germany will see a time of 19:00, viewers in New York will see a time of 13:00, and those from Sydney, Australia will see a time of 05:00.

This relies on the browsers knowledge of the timezone the viewer is located in; as a content provider, all you need to know is the time in UTC of your event.

See the [usage instructions](https://github.com/GregDThomas/jquery-localtime/wiki/Usage) for tull details of how to use the plugin.

The current release is [version 0.6.1](https://github.com/GregDThomas/jquery-localtime/tree/0.6.1/dist).
