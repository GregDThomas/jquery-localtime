# jquery-localtime

This jQuery plug-in designed to display a time in the correct timezone for the viewer; ideal for international audiences of your web site.

For example, if you have an event happening at 10:00 PST (18:00 UTC), viewers in Germany will see a time of 19:00, viewers in New York will see a time of 13:00, and those from Sydney, Australia will see a time of 05:00.

This relies on the browsers knowledge of the timezone the viewer is located in; as a content provider, all you need to know is the time in UTC of your event.

See the [usage instructions](https://github.com/GregDThomas/jquery-localtime/wiki/Usage) for full details of how to use the plugin.

The current release is [version 0.9.1](https://github.com/GregDThomas/jquery-localtime/tree/0.9.1/dist).

If you have any queries, find any problems, have some ideas for improvements, or have anything else you want to discuss about the plugin, please feel free to raise an issue to discuss it!
